# Whisper-PhoWhisper-Speech-To-Text
The notebook reference from [https://github.com/thangnch/MiAI_PhoWhisper](https://github.com/thangnch/MiAI_PhoWhisper).
This repository contains code that I learned from the MIAI YouTube channel. The tutorial how to use the Whisper (Open-AI) and PhoWhisper models (HuggingFace) for speech recognition and convert speech into text using the JavaScript Record and Audio libraries. I have added comments to explain how the libraries and functions work in each code block, including how the JavaScript Speech Record functionality is implemented. There is a chance for me to learn basic codes of NLP, and how to call models from libraries on Google Colab.
